A kdb+ interface to the minpack Fortran code for solving non linear equations
with an application to non linear least squares.

The original Fortran code can be found at the Netlib location
http://www.netlib.org/minpack/index.html

Compilation for Windows(Makefile.win) and Linux (Makefile) has been tested
with gcc only. See the example in test.q
