pykdb is a python module allowing kdb+ objects to be imported into Python similar to qserver for R

The current implementation works for {w32, w64, l32, l64} and for Python{v2.7.?, v3.4.?}

Notable differences:
	1) datetime/timestamp objects are not assumed to be UTC and hence are not adjusted to the 
	machines local time zone as in R but are copied over as-is
	
	2) Timestamp objects are truncated to only 6 digits of fractional seconds
	
	3) All symbols and strings are converted to unicode
